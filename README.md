=== A note on hw4prob2.py ===

Originally intended to be SDSSDR3-G for Sloan Digital Sky Survey g-band, but that service is unavailable. Hence I've substituted it with the Original Digitized Sky Survey (DSS).



Since DSS is much older than SDSSDR3-G, 2MASS point source positions may differ due to proper motion between the years. You can see this in images of M-dwarf stars like AU Mic and TRAPPIST-1.
